# ESP-IDF-Workshop
# Workshop Report: ESP-IDF: IoT Development Framework

## Overview
The Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, in collaboration with ELECSA, organized a workshop titled **‘Jab IDF Met ESP32: A Match Made in Tech Heaven’** on **28th September 2024**. The workshop, conducted by **Mr. Tushar Shenoy**, a 4th-year student, commenced at **9:30 AM** at the Research Hall, NMAMIT. The primary objective was to introduce participants to the ESP-IDF framework, exploring its potential in IoT development and embedded systems programming.

## Introduction
The workshop started with the **installation and setup of the ESP-IDF environment** on participants' systems. The benefits of using ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework), the official development framework for ESP32 and ESP8266 microcontrollers, were explained. The framework provides an extensive set of libraries, tools, and components for IoT applications. Participants were guided through the installation process of necessary tools and the setup of the development environment.

## Presentation Highlights
Following the setup, the presentation focused on key topics:

1. **Introduction to ESP-IDF**  
   The framework supports languages such as **C** and **Python** and provides debugging features like **GDB**. Participants learned how ESP-IDF simplifies development by offering modularity, FreeRTOS integration, and extensive documentation.

2. **Key Features of ESP-IDF**:
   - **Modular Architecture**: The framework's modular design enables developers to use only the components they need, reducing firmware size and improving efficiency.
   - **Real-Time Operating System (FreeRTOS)**: ESP-IDF's integration with FreeRTOS provides multitasking and real-time capabilities essential for complex IoT applications.

3. **ESP-NOW Protocol**  
   One of the highlights was **ESP-NOW**, a low-latency, peer-to-peer wireless communication protocol for ESP32 devices. Its efficiency for battery-powered IoT devices, connectionless nature, and simplified communication were explained.

4. **Peripheral Drivers in ESP-IDF**  
   Participants explored how ESP-IDF supports various peripherals, such as **GPIO**, **ADC/DAC**, **SPI**, and **UART**, making it versatile for interacting with hardware components.

## Hands-on Session
The final segment of the workshop was a **hands-on session** where participants gained practical experience working with the ESP32 microcontroller:

- **LED Blinking**:  
  Participants implemented a simple "LED Blinking" program, where they made an LED blink using GPIO pins.

- **Analog Read**:  
  They explored analog-to-digital conversion by reading sensor values.

- **Overview of ESP-NOW**:  
  The session concluded with a brief demonstration of the ESP-NOW protocol, showcasing how to send and receive data between ESP32 devices.
